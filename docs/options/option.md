Options can be used in different places :
* on the [[cli]] : the name of the option is either :
	* `-<s>`  where *s* is the short name
	* `--<kebab>` where kebab is the [kebab case](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Kebab_case) version of the option (for instance : [[failOpaFast]] becomes `--fail-opa-fast`)
* in a configuration file (see [[config]])
