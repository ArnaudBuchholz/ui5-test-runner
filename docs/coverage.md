# Coverage extraction

## Overview

_(Explain instrumentation)_
_(Explain how coverage data is collected and extracted)_
_(Explain report generation)_

## Legacy mode

Performance issues with UI5

Introduce the hybrid mode where the runner serves the application files and @ui5/cli is used for `ressources/`

## Remote mode

### @ui5/middleware-code-coverage

Good *but* report generation does not work as expected
the runner will fetch files to build the report

### Future ?

ui5-test-runner runs as a proxy
