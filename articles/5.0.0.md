# UI5 Test Runner version 5.0.0

The version 5.0.0 is fresh out of the press.

In this article, we will assume that the reader has no knowledge of UI5 or testing. Hence the first two parts will make a **brief summary** of the framework and a **rapid overview** of testing strategies when developing UIs.

If you are already familiar with these concepts, it is then recommended to jump directly to the last part where `ui5-test-runner` is introduced and the latest version presented.

## UI5

### What is UI5 ?

Because of the name itself, it sounds pretty obvious that UI5 is about **User Interface**.
It's not a mystery, there are many UI development frameworks *(and libraries)* existing for JavaScript.

A quick look to [state of JS](https://2022.stateofjs.com/en-US/libraries/front-end-frameworks/) illustrates that the most used are : [React](https://react.dev/), [Angular](https://angular.io/) and [Vue](https://vuejs.org/).

Then what is UI5 and why is it relevant ?

> Presentation video of "What is SAPUI5?"

To quote the above video description : *SAPUI5 is an HTML5 framework for creating cross-platform, enterprise-grade web applications in an efficient way*.

This framework was first released in 2012. To summarize its core values :

* It is **responsive** and offers a **consistent user experience** across devices,
* It contains hundreds of **standardized components** to build **enterprise-grade** applications,
* It relies on **robust development concepts**, such as :
  * Object Oriented Programming,
  * Model-View-Controller pattern,
  * Data source bindings,
  * Translation & Internationalization,
  * Extensibility,
  * ...

The next two screenshots are captured from the **same** [sample application](https://ui5.sap.com/test-resources/sap/m/demokit/orderbrowser/webapp/test/mockServer.html?sap-ui-theme=sap_horizon_dark) displayed on **different** devices.

UI5 comes with a **different paradigm** : instead of letting the developers struggle with HTML *(like most popular frameworks)*, it is **widget-based**. It means that the developer focuses more on building the user interface in terms of **assembling components** rather than fine tuning HTML and CSS to create a decent look.

The following example illustrates how to design login screen with an XML syntax.

```xml
<core:View height="100%" controllerName="app.controllers.login" xmlns="sap.m" xmlns:core="sap.ui.core">   
  <Page id="loginPage" enableScrolling="false" title="{i18n>LoginPageTitle}">
    <VBox fitContainer="true" justifyContent="Center" alignItems="Center">
      <Label id="lblLogin" text="{i18n>Login}" labelFor="inpLogin" />
      <Input id="inpLogin" editable="true" />
      <Label id="lblPassword" text="{i18n>Password}" labelFor="inpPassword" />
      <Input id="inpPassword" type="Password" editable="true" />
      <Button id="bntLogin" text="{i18n>Login}" press="onLogin" />
    </VBox>
  </Page>
</core:View>
```

> Login View expressed in XML

### A growing ecosystem

The UI5 framework exists in two flavors :

* [Open UI5](https://github.com/SAP/openui5) : the **open source** version *(which was first released in 2013)*, distributed under the [Apache License 2.0](https://github.com/SAP/openui5/blob/master/LICENSE.txt),
* [SapUI5](https://ui5.sap.com/) : the **enterprise version** which basically *extends* open UI5 with more controls.

A [growing ecosystem](https://ui5-community.github.io/ui5-ecosystem-showcase/) of tools and helpers makes it easier to build new applications with UI5.
In particular, the following tools are **almost required** for any new development.

#### UI5 Tooling

Also known as the `@ui5/cli` tool *(which is the NPM package name to install)*, this command line regroups a [collection of tools](https://sap.github.io/ui5-tooling/v3/) to help **setup, run and build** UI5 applications.

For local development, the application is served with the command `ui5 serve`. A configurable list of [middlewares](https://sap.github.io/ui5-tooling/v3/pages/Server/) can be setup to **alter** the server behavior. For instance :

* The backend can be **mocked** to simulate API calls,
* Source files can be **instrumented** on the fly to collect the code coverage while running the tests,
* ...

In the following example, the `@ui5/middleware-code-coverage` is used to enable code coverage consolidation while running tests.

```yaml
specVersion: '3.0'
metadata:
  name: training-ui5con18-opa
type: application
server:
  customMiddleware:
  - name: "@ui5/middleware-code-coverage"
    afterMiddleware: compression
    configuration:
      instrument:
        produceSourceMap: true
        coverageGlobalScope: "window.top"
        coverageGlobalScopeFunc: false
      excludePatterns:
        - "test/"
        - "resources/"
```

> `ui5.yaml` configuration file declaring the `@ui5/middleware-code-coverage` middleware

#### TypeScript support

The framework is now **supporting TypeScript** with the help of additional tools. For instance, the framework implements a specific dependency injection method ([`sap.ui.require`](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.ui%23methods/sap.ui.require)) which can be **transpiled from** the `import` statement.

TypeScript **completes** UI5 perfectly as every control is clearly **defined and documented**. Hence, UI5 publishes [type definitions](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@types/openui5) for its libraries.
This way, the development environment benefits from **auto-completion** and, while transpiling, the code is being **validated** against types.

All the documentation about how to use TypeScript in UI5 can be found [here](https://sap.github.io/ui5-typescript/).

## Test

The best way to summarize the **testing strategies** is to explain the **test pyramid** : this visual concept enumerates the **different types** of tests and **quantifies** how much of each type should be done in an ideal project.

![Test pyramid](test-pyramid.png)

> Test pyramid with the equivalent technologies

At the bottom of the pyramid, the larger base, there are unit tests : they must be **cheap** to develop and **fast** to execute. They must cover **most** of the code. On the opposite, at the top of the pyramid, manual tests are usually **expensive** and **slow** : one would focus only on **few** scenarios.

A longer and deeper explanation can be found in [The Practical Test Pyramid](https://martinfowler.com/articles/practical-test-pyramid.html) from *Ham Vocke*.

UI5 bundles several technologies to implement unit and component tests :

* [QUnit](https://qunitjs.com/) for unit tests,
* [OPA](https://ui5.sap.com/sdk/#/topic/22f175e7084247bc896c15280af9d1dc) for component tests *(with the help of Mock Server to simulate ODATA v2 APIs)*.

The browse orders sample application provides examples of these tests :

* [Unit tests : `https://ui5.sap.com/test-resources/sap/m/demokit/orderbrowser/webapp/test/unit/unitTests.qunit.html`](https://ui5.sap.com/test-resources/sap/m/demokit/orderbrowser/webapp/test/unit/unitTests.qunit.html)
* [OPA tests : `https://ui5.sap.com/test-resources/sap/m/demokit/orderbrowser/webapp/test/integration/opaTests.qunit.html`](https://ui5.sap.com/test-resources/sap/m/demokit/orderbrowser/webapp/test/integration/opaTests.qunit.html)

From a technology point of view (QUnit and OPA), the [Testing SAPUI5 Application](https://www.sap-press.com/testing-sapui5-applications_5056/) E-Book provides all the necessary guidelines to build such tests.

Also, the [Clean SAPUI5](https://www.sap-press.com/clean-sapui5_5479/) book provides guidance on how to unit test views, controllers...

Executing these tests is as easy as opening a web page in a browser.
UI5 standard is to define one page (usually named `testsuite.qunit.html`) which enumerates the existing pages.

> IT LOOKS LIKE THE STANDARD HAS CHANGED

```html
<html>
  <head>
    <title>TestSuite</title>
  	<script src="./resources/sap/ui/qunit/qunit-redirect.js"></script>
    <script>
function suite () {
  const oSuite = new parent.jsUnitTestSuite(),
        sContextPath = location.toString().substring(0, location.toString().lastIndexOf("/") + 1);
	oSuite.addTestPage(sContextPath + "unit/unitTests.qunit.html");
  oSuite.addTestPage(sContextPath + "integration/opaTests.qunit.html");
	return oSuite;
}
    </script>
  </head>
</html>
```

### Karma

In order to execute these tests in a CI/CD pipeline, a karma runner was customized to support UI5 specificities

## Runner

### Installation

`ui5-test-runner` is available as a [NPM package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ui5-test-runner) and can be installed either globally or locally to a project. For the sake of simplicity, in the rest of the article, we consider it to be installed globally.

![installation](setup.gif)
> `npm install ui5-test-runner --global`

Almost no dependencies, very small package
https://packagephobia.com/result?p=ui5-test-runner

Additional dependencies are added on-demand, only if not found locally.

### First run

For instance, the `--capabilities` option triggers a suite of tests that validates the use of a browser. By default, `puppeteer` is used as shown in the following example.

![capabilities](capabilities.gif)
> `ui5-test-runner --capabilities`

### OPA tests performances

### Fixes and project structure

Who would decently create a test runner without making sure that it is fully tested ?
